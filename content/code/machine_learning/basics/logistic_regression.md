Logistic function or sigmoid function
$$f(z) = \dfrac{1}{1+ e^{-z}}$$
- Special gradient:
$$f'(z)= f(z)(1-f(x))$$
- Exponential family distribution
- Maximum likelihood
- Bernoulli distribution (1-0)
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Logistic regression: it is a regression model, not a classificition one, read more on quora to clarify this point.
